# Bugs

Safety violations found by the fuzzer. Each entry records the seed, the
minimal reproducing trace, the property that broke, and the root cause.

Reproduce any of these with `pytest tests/test_fuzz_sweep.py --seed <N>`.

## Restart steals leadership from a healthy leader

Found by: `test_restart_does_not_disrupt_cluster`

`election_deadline` was drawn once at construction, relative to `now=0`. At
cluster boot that is correct. On `Cluster.restart()`, which happens thousands
of simulated milliseconds in, the restarted node's deadline was already long
expired, so it fired an election on its first tick and could depose a healthy
leader. Every node restart was a cluster disruption.

Fix: defer the first deadline draw to the node's first `tick(now)`, so
construction and restart behave identically.

## Messages silently dropped on node id type mismatch

Found by: no convergence across 20 seeds over 50,000 simulated ms

`RaftNode` addresses peers as `str` while `Cluster` keys nodes by `int`.
Every routed message looked addressed to a nonexistent node and was dropped
with no error. Nodes never heard each other's votes and livelocked in
perpetual re-election — a symptom indistinguishable from a split-vote bug in
the election logic.

Fix: a `RaftClusterNode` adapter translating `int` and `str` at the
`tick`/`handle` boundary.
